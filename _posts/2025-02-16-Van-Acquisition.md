Finally the day had come, we were to be real-life hippies in just a few hours time! The day passed rather quickly on account of some heavy reading sessions first at Auckland harbour, then the swish city library, "Come on shore and we will kill you and eat you all" is proving a rather good read! 

By 17:00, the van was ours! We packed our bags in and set-off for Piha/Anawhata arriving just in time for sunset. Zucchini and lemon pasta served, we made ourselves comfy ready to spend our first night in a beach carpark.
