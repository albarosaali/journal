Stunning weather, and oats, to start the day at Uretiti. A quick morning dip turned into beach-lounging until lunch; a modern translation of The Canterbury Tales serving up some good mind food. Uretiti beach is a magnificent expanse of sand with island views and crystal clear water.

The afternoon took us to Waipu: a quaint, nearby town with one high street, where we spent the rest of the day shopping and snooping around. An outstanding lager - Longboarder - was indeed imbibed at McLeod's, the local pub, there we met Jeff, though it might be more accurate to say Jeff met us. Generous Jeff is a more apt name on account of the free bottle of wine, and beer that he gave us, wishing us good luck on our travels as he did so!

The heavens opened mid pasta cooking. An early night.
