Hot on the heels of our first viewing, we arranged a pre-purchase inspection. 9:45. It didn't finish until 14:00!! We got to know Thomas and Alicia rather well in that time, and post inspection, the next steps were agreed.
Later on we met Lizzie and Piers on the waterfront; we shared some snackachangi and some good NZ curiosities (Piers grewcup in Tauranga).
