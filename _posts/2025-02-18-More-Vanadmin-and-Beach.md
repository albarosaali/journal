More delicious, you guessed it, oats to start the day! A great source of energy to get us through the admin of campsite finding, AA insurance, van ownership transfer, RUCS and tool finding.

In the afternoon, the sun mobilised its hottest rays, and so, a beach was found. We dipped our toes and read for a few hours soaking up the heat.

Starting at Bruce Pullman Motorhome park for another night. Noodles with tofu, pad choi, kimchi and spring onion for dinner.
