# The Day of Departure.
The remnants of a lavish dinner at Santoria arose with me on this day, the first day of a new adventure!
Bags finally packed, with a pain au chocolate snack, the tube beckoned for Heathrow. Maddy and co awaited at Caffe Nero for final goodbyes, best attempts made to avoid teary eyes as we were let go. Time to fly!
