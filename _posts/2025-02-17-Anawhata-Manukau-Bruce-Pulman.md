The morning began in splendid (if a little rainy) isolation, not another soul in sight nor any buildings.
After another delicious breakfast (oats again!), and a few phone calls, we set off down the trail to Anawhata beach. An almost alien landscape stood before our eyes as we took the first few steps onto the black volcanic sand that so sharply contrasted the vivid green of the forest from which we had just stepped out of. About 45 minutes and a swim later, we took ourselves and our photos back to the van for a quick visit to Piha and the famous Lion's rock, where a
spectacular passion fruit ice cream was enjoyed not a small amount by yours truly, before driving down to Barry in Manukau.

We now find ourselves staying in Bruce Pulman Motorhome Park: an enormous car park by a pond and otherwise surrounded by playing fields. Shakshuka tonight.
