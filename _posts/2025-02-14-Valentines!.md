A lightning start to the day, courtesy of the STRONG filter coffee at the Fed, electrified my senses ready for the day ahead. Good job it did, it was busy! Maddy took us stomping up Maungawhau, to the was memorial museum, on to the winter garden (where we found out about a Red bull trolley race!), then Albert Park and the NZ art gallery before heading back to the hostel for a mid-afternoon break. 

A final price of $12250 was agreed for the van!

We returned, once again, to the Fed for dinner. This time accompanied by Lizzie where we ate a meatloaf, fennel and apple salad plus poutine! Scrumptious! 

A 'dad joke' card from Maddy capped a splendid day.
