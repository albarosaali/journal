This morning we got the anti-sway bar bushes replaced by the friendly lot at 09 automotive ready for our imminent departure to the Northlands; they recommended that we visit Ruakaka. Auckland Botanic Gardens kept us entertained in the meantime with it's excellent plants, sculptures and caf√© - the bacon frittata really was rather delicious- until we were notified by text to pick our ran up.

We printed out our DOC (Department of Conservation) campsite pass, and after a swift lunch headed upto North! Mangawhai was our first stop on the way where we took in a dramatic coastline with islands poking out of the misty ocean horizon. After a quick dip we carried on our way to Uretiti, slowing down to take in the sights of Waipu Cove and Lang's beach, before we arrived and set-up camp there.

Noodles for dinner again, but the highlight of this evening was undoubtedly the availability of a shower!
