Morning run around the marina, Manu Manu competition spotted: crazy water flips and splashes! Lamb sandwich prepared ready for a day out at the Red Bull Trolley Race at the domain! So many crazy contraptions, the Wurst Case Scenario and DadMax entries were particularly wild! Crashes, cheers and commentary (razor sharp NZ wit I must say) made for a fab afternoon, despite a heavy dousing of water.
