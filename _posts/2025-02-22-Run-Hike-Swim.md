At 07:30 we made a swift exit from Whangarei Falls, donned our running kit, and made a bee-line for the local Parkrun which started at 8am under Te Matau Pohe Bridge.
Parkrun complete, the next stop was Ocean Beach to take on the Bream Head/Te Whara trail, which takes you 476m up and past a WW2 radar station. A constantly steep, gruelling incline it was. Nevertheless 1.5 hours later we reached the head. Golly it was worth it! A friendly Thai Lady beckoned us slightly higher still where we were greeted by a spectacular 360 degree vista of Whangarei Heads and ocean, stunning.
 
Three hours all in, we wolfed down some lunch, and made our way down to Ocean beach for a cooling dip and some reading, occasionally interrupted by the parasol making a break for it.

Later, with Whale Bay in our sights we drove on in search of a free camping spot nearby until we stumbled upon a beach gig! Panzanella-ish salad in pan, we sat, ate, and listened while the sun set. Eventually, we made our base in a Matapouri car park. Goodnight!
