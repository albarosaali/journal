Oats acquired and Manuka honey desire fulfilled, we caught a bus to meet Tate and his van, in which, despite being allegedly high roofed, we could not stand. No matter! Soon after we met Alicia and Tomas and their 2003 LWB Toyota Hiace, a gem!
We were sold! A celebratory gander around Ponsonby followed: Copain coffee and NZ ice-cream, markedly tasty treats enjoyed in view of Western Park.
Phones sorted, admin day took its toll. 2hr
nap followed by bed!
