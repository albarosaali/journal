This morning consisted of a beach run, oats, and some frantic packing for campsite check out. Following a
short post run at Waipu we set off for Whangarei. We made one stop at Ruakaka, on the recommendation of our mechanic, where we took in some great views of Bream Bay and stocked up on water. 

The info centre at Whangarei suggested we visit the Hundertwasser museum. It was good! He has a very distinctive style and some fantastic architectural ideas - the museum itself was certainly something! A very friendly lady offered to take some photos of
us too.

We pottered around town for a bit before heading to the town basin for dumplings and a BBQ pork bun snack at a street food market, yummay, then set off to see Raumanga falls; a satisfying aqua-cascade.

Tonight we have made base at Whangarei falls car park. Soy glazed aubergine, pak choi, eggs, and rice for dinner.
